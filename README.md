# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

My motivation was to become more organized and to stay on task by creating a project management application. Why I built this project is I wanted to show how I was able to utilize HTML, CSS, and jQuery to create an application that is dynamically updated. The problems I solved were updating the calendar theme colors based of the current time and optimizing the calendar so it saves details dynamically. What I learned was how to create a dynamic day calendar that I can use as a project management tool.

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
